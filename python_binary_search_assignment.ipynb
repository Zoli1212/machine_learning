Further, it is the only number in the list which is smaller than the number before it. Thus, we simply need to **check for each number in the list whether it is smaller than the number that comes before it** (if there is a number before it). Then, our answer i.e. the number of rotations is simply the position of this number is . If we cannot find such a number, then the list wasn't rotated at all.\n",
